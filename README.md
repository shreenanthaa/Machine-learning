# chennai-realestate-price-analysis-prediction
This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction . We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using chennai home prices dataset from kaggle.com. During model building performed tasks such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers,

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
